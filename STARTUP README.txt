October 14: Startup README

To open Scenario, open the Germany425.afproj file

To run scenario locally the cluster_startup_local.txt needs to be set as the startup file (should already be set up)

To run scenario through the cluster Python script the cluster_startuo_local.txt should be either removed from startup_files or commented out.
