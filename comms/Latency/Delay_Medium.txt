#TO DO: Need to figure out how to use a table for latency values that can be used in real time. 
# Suggestion can be creating a python script that can create "modes" for each value for latency and then the script for ModeOnTransmit
# iterate through the modes
# Another suggestion is replace the current way we send messages with a script to send message, delay that send by a value from a table
medium LATENCY WSF_COMM_MEDIUM_UNGUIDED 


#transfer_rate /variable 10
packet_loss_time 0 s
#packet_loss_time $<LATENCY: 1>$ s

end_medium
